    <p>Answer 1: My first impression was positive and visually interested. The page feels like a travel brochure. There are beautiful photos, clear headings for all the parks and a trip planning tone that invites exploration with included maps.</p>

    <p>Answer 2: The flow of information is organized in parts that ease the reader into first general information and pictures then trip planning. There is a short intro followed by sections for each park and Plan your trip links. There are also clearly labeled sections so users can find the resource they need.</p>

    <p>Answer 3: The structure makes sense. The page groups the info in sesible ways which is exactly what a visitor would need. The pattern makes the site much easier to understand and surf.</p>

    <p>Answer 4: The graphics and multimedia enhance the site. Large photos and small photos give the page visual appeal and help communicate the beauty of each park. Images support the content, which improves the engagement and the sites feel.</p>

    <p>Answer 5: The home page loaded very quickly though while scrolling through the map area the website did struggle for a few seconds.</p>

    <p>Answer 6: It was overall pleasent. Text color, size, and contrast are readable. Text is a comfortable size that allows easy reading. Where photos are, text is kept separate and adds to the fluidity. The color complements the imagery and does not interfere.</p>

    <p>Answer 7: The site has a prominent navigation bar with destination categories. The navigation is well done.</p>

    <p>Answer 8: The site uses an earth tone color scheme with warm reds and oranges like the rock photos and neutral text backgrounds. That consistent solor and design reinforces the theme of exploration and adventure.</p>

    <p>Answer 9: The site is responsive. When viewed from an IPhone it responded and still kept the same design.</p>

    <p>Answer 10: The Explore this page links and the individual Plan your trip links for each park are very useful for trip planning. The action plans makes it more than just a picture gallery.</p>
